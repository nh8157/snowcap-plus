/// # One Strategy To Rule Them All
///
/// This is the one strategy to rule them all, combining the best from the
/// [`TreeStrategy`](crate::strategies::TreeStrategy) and the
/// [`DepGroupsStrategy`](crate::strategies::DepGroupsStrategy) into one single strategy.
///
/// ## Description
///
/// The stretegy works by exploring the search space of all possible orderings in a tree-like
/// manner. This means, that it proceeds by taking one valid modifier, while building a tree of
/// which leaves need to be explored later. Once there are no other valid modifiers to try, we are
/// stuck.
///
/// When we are stuck, we try to solve the current problem by finding a dependency group. This
/// procedure is explained in detail [here](#detailed-explenation-of-finding-dependencies). If a
/// dependency with a valid solution could be found, then we reset the exploration tree, but with
/// the group now treated as one single modifier. If however no dependency group could be learned,
/// then backtrack in the current exploration tree, until we have either explored everything, or
/// found a valid solution.
///
/// ### Detailed Explenation of finding dependencies
///
/// When we are stuck, we try to solve the current problem by finding a dependency group. This is
/// done in three distinct phases. The input to all phases is the current ordering of all groups,
/// including the point where applying the first group fails.
///
/// 1. **Reduction Phase**: In reduciton phase, we try to eliminate groups that seem to have no
///    impact on the dependency group. To do this, we iterate over all groups in the orering (except
///    the problematic group), remove it temporarily from the ordering (to obtain `probe_ordering`)
///    and simulate this new ordering. If this removal has absolutely no effect on the outcome, we
///    call this group to be independent of the problem.
///
///    Notice, that it might happen that the new ordering now fails at an earlier position. In this
///    case, we recursively call `reduce` again, but with the probed group removed. Then, we ad the
///    group back to the beginning of the resulting ordering, but only if the call resulted in no
///    additional recursion.
///
///    The following pseudocode illustrates the procedure:
///
///    ```rust,ignore
///    fn reduce(ordering: Vec<Group>, error: Error) -> Vec<Group> {
///
///        for i in 0..ordering.len() - 1 {
///            // generate the probe ordering by removing the group at position i.
///            let probe_group = ordering[i];
///            let probe_ordering = ordering.clone().remove(i);
///
///            // check the new group
///            match check(probe_ordering) {
///                Ok(()) => {
///                    // Current ordering is dependent on the probed group, because it solves the
///                    // problem.
///                }
///                Err(new_error) if new_error.position != error.position() => {
///                    // The probed ordering fails at a different position! Recursive make the
///                    // problem smaller
///                    let reduced_ordering = reduce(probe_ordering[..new_error.position + 1]);
///                    // insert the probe group back (but only if the level of recursion is
///                    // only 1, i.e., the problem was not made smaller by the call to `reduce`
///                    // above.)
///                    reduced_ordering.insert(0, probe_group);
///                    return reduced_ordering;
///                }
///                Err(new_error) if new_error != error => {
///                    // Current ordering is dependent on the probed group, because it changes the
///                    // error
///                }
///                Err(new_error) if new_error == error => {
///                    // Current ordering is independent on the probed group, because it has no
///                    // effect on the outcome of the network. Remove the group indefinately from
///                    // the ordering.
///                    ordering.remove(i)
///                }
///            }
///        }
///        return ordering
///
///    }
///    ```
///
/// 2. **Solving Phase**: In this phase, we try to find a solution to the reduced problem. This is
///    done using the already existing [`TreeStrategy`](crate::strategies::TreeStrategy). If we can
///    find a valid solution to this problem, then we have found a dependency, and we add it to the
///    list of dependency groups, in the ordering that we have determined. However, if we cannot
///    find any valid solution, we go to step 3 and try to expand the group.
///
/// 3. **Expansion Phase**: In this phase, we try to expand the problem in order to still be abe to
///    find a valid solution. To do this, we iterate over all not yet used groups (excluding those
///    who have already been removed in the reduction phase) and try to place this group at every
///    possible position in the ordering. If the error changes at any point, where the probed grou
///    is moved to, then we add this group to the reduced problem. Once we have found one group with
///    which to extend the problem, we exit and go back to step 2.
///
///    There might be the case, where the probed group changes the problematic group (i.e., the
///    group where the problem happens). In this case, we insert the probed group into this position
///    and go back to step 1, reducing the problem even further.
///
///    The following pseudocode illustrates the procedure:
///
///    ```rust,ignore
///    fn expand(ordering: Vec<Group>, unused: Vec<Group>, error: Error) -> Result<Vec<Group>> {
///
///        // iterate over all unused groups
///        for probe_group in unused {
///            // iterate over all positions where this gorup might be added
///            for i in 0..ordering.range() {
///
///                // generate the probe ordering by removing the group at position i.
///                let probe_ordering = ordering.clone().insert(i, probe_group);
///
///                // check the new group
///                match check(probe_ordering) {
///                    Ok(()) => {
///                        // The probed group seems to be dependent. Add it to the group. Since we
///                        // know, that this is already a solved gorup, we can skip the solving
///                        // phase, and directly call this a new group
///                        return Finish(probe_group)
